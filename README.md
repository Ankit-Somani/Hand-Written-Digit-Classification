# Hand Written Digit Classification
This app uses MNIST dataset to recognise hand written digits and uses Convolutional neural networks to build the model. A python GUI is built using tkinter library to enable users draw digits and see the displayed recognitions.

## Instructions to run the app locally: ##
* Train the model using training.py: 
  * `python training.py`
* Run the file in which python GUI is built: 
  * `python gui.py`
  
The output would look something like the following:
